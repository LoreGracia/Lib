Libft is a custom library written in C that contains a set of standard functions from the C library along with some additional utility functions useful for developing C projects. This project is part of the 42 programming school's curriculum and aims to reinforce knowledge of basic C language concepts, memory management, and the implementation of simple data structures.

## Features

- Recreation of standard C library functions (`string.h`, `stdlib.h`, etc.).
- Auxiliary functions for manipulating strings, memory, and linked lists.
- Basic implementation of data structures such as linked lists and related operations.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```bash
.
├── *.h              # Header file -> libft.h
├── *.c              # Source files
├── Makefile         # Script to compile the library
└── libft.a          # Compiled library (generated after running 'make')
```

see the <a href=https://github.com/LoreGracia/42/blob/004837ce85103b4f40fad06aedc5b1ed7378c17d/Libft/en.subject.pdf>subject</a> for more details.

## Installation

To compile the library and generate the libft.a file, follow these steps:

### Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone [repository link]
cd [new folder]
```

### Compile the library:
```bash
make
```

### Usage
Once compiled the library, it can be used as follows:

Include header files in your code:
```c
#include "libft.h"
```

### Start using the functions
For example:
